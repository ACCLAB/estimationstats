		To compare two or more similar experiments, it is often convenient to place a number of two-groups results into a single arrangement. In this plot, the mean difference can no longer be placed to the right. Instead, the two or more mean differences are plotted below the observed values axes in new delta axes. This allows the direct visual comparison of multiple mean differences (‘deltas’).
